=======================

Code from the Wumpus coding dojo: exploring diversity, hold in March 2013

We were creating the Wumpus game. Mutliple pairs worked at the same time,
people switched pair every 15 min (1 person on one codebase for 30 min).

See the description of the dojo in the `about-dojo.html` file.

Observations
------------
* switching every 15 min is hard but possible
* most designs are quite similar with one exception (Asgeir's PC)
* people focused on getting something done in the short time => ugly code
  that would profit from refactoring
